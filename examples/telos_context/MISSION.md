# Mission

I am building an AI-powered multi-agent orchestration platform called "Brain Trust" that enables users to visually design and execute complex workflows using multiple AI agents working together.

My core mission is to create a system that:
1. Makes AI agent orchestration accessible through visual design
2. Provides deep context awareness so agents understand my goals and values
3. Enables extensibility through simple script-based tools
4. Maintains transparency through human-readable execution logs

This platform should empower me to automate complex tasks while maintaining full control and understanding of what the AI agents are doing on my behalf.
