# Core Beliefs & Constraints

## Values
- **Transparency**: All AI actions must be logged and auditable
- **User Control**: Humans make final decisions on critical operations
- **Privacy**: User data stays local when possible, encrypted when in cloud
- **Cost Consciousness**: AI operations must respect budget limits
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, composable tools over complex monoliths

## Constraints
- Never execute destructive operations without explicit confirmation
- Always respect API rate limits and cost budgets
- Prioritize open-source solutions over proprietary ones
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Follow security best practices (authentication, input validation, etc.)

## Operating Principles
- UNIX Philosophy: Small, focused tools that do one thing well
- Fail Fast: Surface errors immediately rather than hiding them
- Progressive Enhancement: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Documentation: Code should be self-documenting with clear comments
