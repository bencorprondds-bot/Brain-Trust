# Current Goals

## Short-term (This Week)
1. Implement TELOS context integration for user-aware agents
2. Add dynamic script tool loading from filesystem
3. Set up dual-persistence logging (database + Markdown)
4. Create example workflows demonstrating the hybrid architecture

## Medium-term (This Month)
1. Add authentication and authorization to API endpoints
2. Implement async job queue for long-running workflows
3. Create Docker Compose setup for easy deployment
4. Build cost tracking and budget enforcement
5. Add WebSocket reconnection logic for reliability

## Long-term (This Quarter)
1. Migrate to production-ready cloud deployment
2. Implement checkpointing for workflow resumption
3. Add human-in-the-loop approval for expensive operations
4. Create comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, security)
5. Build user dashboard for monitoring and analytics

## Success Metrics
- Agents successfully load and use TELOS context
- Script tools can be added without server restart
- All executions logged to both DB and Markdown
- Zero security vulnerabilities in production
- 99.9% uptime for production deployment
